      &quot;That day, the human race remembered the terror of being dominated by
      them, and the shame of being held captive in a birdcage...&quot; â€” Over
      100 years ago, a natural predator of humanity appeared: the Titans, giant
      humanoid but mindless monsters whose sole purpose of existence seemed to
      be to devour humans. There was an insurmountable gap in power between them
      and mankind, and as a result, humanity was rapidly exterminated to the
      brink of extinction. The survivors responded by constructing three
      concentric walls: Wall Maria, Wall Rose and Wall Sina, which graced them
      with a century of peace. However, one day a Colossal Titan far larger than
      any other seen before breached the outer wall, allowing the smaller Titans
      to invade the human territory and forcing the survivors to retreat to the
      inner walls. Eren Jaeger, a boy whose mother was eaten during the
      invasion, vowed to wipe every last Titan off the face of the Earth, and
      joined the military determined to exact his revenge.
