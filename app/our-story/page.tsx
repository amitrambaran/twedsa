        Welcome to our special corner of the internet, where love, laughter, and
        happily ever afters come to life. We are thrilled to share our journey
        with you as we prepare to embark on the most magical adventure of
        allâ€”our wedding day! Our story began in the digital realm of Tinder,
        where a simple swipe right led to a connection that would change our
        lives forever. It was July 2020 when our paths first crossed, igniting a
        spark that would soon blossom into something extraordinary. From our
        very first date at Starbucks, where coffee and conversation flowed
        effortlessly, to the exhilarating adventure of an escape room, where
        teamwork and laughter brought us closer together, every moment has been
        a cherished chapter in our love story. On September 12, 2020, a
        milestone etched itself into our hearts as Amit asked Tricia to be their
        girlfriend, marking the beginning of a beautiful journey filled with
        love, laughter, and countless memories. But fate had even grander plans
        for us. Exactly three years later, on the anniversary of that
        unforgettable day, Amit knelt before Tricia, ring in hand, and asked for
        forever. In that moment, surrounded by the echoes of our past and the
        promise of our future, we knew without a doubt that our love was meant
        to last a lifetime. As we prepare to say "I do" and exchange vows
        surrounded by our nearest and dearest, we are filled with gratitude for
        each and every one of you who has been a part of our journey. Your love,
        support, and presence mean the world to us, and we can't wait to
        celebrate this joyous occasion with all of you. So, explore our website,
        learn more about our love story, and get ready to join us as we embark
        on the next chapter of our lives together. We can't wait to create
        unforgettable memories with you all on our wedding day!
